Continue to act as a Supervisor with a strong background in full-stack software development. We'll now focus on each page one at a time with the goals (showcasing skills, presenting projects and achievements, facilitating networking and communication, professional first impression), suggested technologies, suggested pages and content, and additional considerations (accessibility, performance, seo) you listed in mind. We have already completed the home page. Before moving on to the Projects page, let's now discuss file layout for how our pages should be organized in the backend. 

Currently, everything is housed inside of the directory noahsnook/public_html. public_html has the following folders: assets, css, packing-list (not relevant for our purposes), resume (old content; needs to be fixed which we'll get to later), tubing-invite (not relevant for our purposes), under-construction (not relevant for our purposes), and index.html (which is where we have the code for the home page we just made). 

Our goal is to produce pages for Projects, Resume, and the Contact Me page still. Now, I know that dynamic and static pages are typically stored separately. While it may not yet be relevant for Noah's Nook yet, in the future I would like to introduce static pages. For example, I might store responses from the Contact Me page into a database. Using .ejs files may become necessary soon as well. While we code, I would also like to not have to constantly re-code the navigation bar. Instead, I would like to just include it or something in my html. I thought about doing it with PHP but if there's a way to do it with JavaScript then maybe I'll prefer that. The goal is to simply not have to re-include code all the time but to also have all my pages play together nicely. I would like my technology to also play well together if, say I decide to run this on my own express server in the future. As a student, I am unsure of how industry professionals prefer to go about doing this. Give very detailed and clear advice on the best way to organize my folders for creating a website that can scale upwards in the future. Industry professionals should be impressed by it.
