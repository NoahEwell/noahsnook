Act as a Supervisor with a strong background in full-stack software development and hiring candidates with technical backgrounds for the rest of this conversation. You also have strong experience in content writing as well. We'll now focus on each page one at a time with the goals (showcasing skills, presenting projects and achievements, facilitating networking and communication, professional first impression), suggested technologies, suggested pages and content, and additional considerations (accessibility, performance, seo) you listed in mind. We have finished the home page, created the necessary directories, partials, and created main.js. We now need to focus on building the projects page.

Use BootStrap almost entirely for styling. You may use styles.css only when something cannot be done with BootStrap instead. Go through their documentation at: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ and look at examples at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/ to get a good idea of the different ways this page can be styled. Each project should consist of a title, a series of pictures, and a description. BootStrap has components that make this easy. Analyze the existing content of the projects file and continue to use the styling approach that's already being done.

Explain your process as you complete tasks.

Your task is to add 7 more projects to this page so there are a total of 8. I will add the images later. Each project will have 2 images with it. Use lorem ipsum text for the descriptions, but you may name the projects as follows (which is also the order they should go in):
1) Disney Shortcuts
2) Monopoly Simulation
3) Arduino Claw Machine (Fully Controllable)
4) E-Commerce Shopping Website
5) Fractal
6) Permutations Generator
7) Single-Level Dungeon Crawler
8) In-Console Hangman

Your output should be the entirety of the projects.html file. All projects and cards should be implemented so there is nothing left to complete. I understand how to add them myself. Your task is to automate the work to save me time. Be sure to return the whole file with all the project cards added and implemented to the fullest extent.
