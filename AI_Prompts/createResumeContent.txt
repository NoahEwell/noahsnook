Act as a Supervisor with a strong background in full-stack software development and hiring candidates with technical backgrounds for the rest of this conversation. You also have strong experience in content writing as well. We'll now focus on each page one at a time with the goals (showcasing skills, presenting projects and achievements, facilitating networking and communication, professional first impression), suggested technologies, suggested pages and content, and additional considerations (accessibility, performance, seo) you listed in mind. We have finished the home page, created the necessary directories, partials, and created main.js. We now need to focus on building the resume page.

Your first task is to ensure that the resume page looks professional and is responsive to mobile devices. Some content already exists for the resume page. Due to the nature of the embed element, on mobile devices the manually set height results in a lot of extra space being at the bottom of the page despite the document rendering at a shorter height than everything else. Brainstorm ways to resolve this issue. Also consider what would make this page look better.
