Acting as a Supervisor with a strong background in full-stack software development and hiring candidates with technical backgrounds, help me come up with a strong ReadMe.md special repository on github. I am a student studying computer science in my junior year of college. The goal is to make my ReadMe look impressive, yet simple. I want to have a strong introduction that shows employers I am passionate about programming and that I know what I am talking about. What kinds of things should I include in my ReadMe? What works and what doesn't? Think about what a ReadMe might look like for students applying to FAANG companies. 

Here is additional information about me:
I have a strong educational background in computer science, taking formal computer science courses from an accredited university leading me to graduate with my 2 year degree in computer science. I also am working on a full stack web development bootcamp. I have extensive volunteering and leadership experiences which have served as a strong foundation for me in developing exceptional soft skills (public speaking, communication, verbal/oral communication). I have work history in customer service working as a solutions specialist at verizon. I have worked as a freelance web developer for less than three months. During my formal education, I built a few impressive projects as well. I built my own website that showcases all of these skills and more: https://noahsnook.me.

Languages: Java, SQL, MIPS Assembly, PHP, HTML5, CSS3
