Acting as a Supervisor with a strong background in full-stack software development, help me create the backend architecture of Noah's Nook. While a lot of Noah's Nook remains static, I would like to create a page that fulfills the following requirements:
- Gets movies from a mySQL database and displays contents to the user.
- Users can login and put in new movies or click an 'X' to remove them from the database.
- Users can click a button to spin a wheel and get a random movie from the database. 

For now, we are just focusing on planning the architecture. I want to organize the file system and decide what is going where, as well as a naming schema. I might add additional database-dependent pages in the future, or even modify current static-only pages to connect to a database. Currently, Noah's Nook looks roughly like this:

│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── css/
│   │   ├── images/

I'd like to use ejs and nodejs to connect to a MySQL server. I am using MochaHost to currently host my website. I did something similar using PHP once but don't remember it well. For now, how should I organize the file structure? What's the relationship between my ejs files, my static files, and my database? How can I connect to a MySQL database using Node or EJS? What if I wanted to host my website from a personal computer server in the future? Would I use Express for that? And how would MySQL work then? 


Prompt 2:

So public_html is where all of my static files go. I notice that partials exists in both backend/views as well as in public_html/assets. What's the reasoning behind this?

Controllers is the folder that handles requests and responses.

Models contains database queries and schemas. All of this can be done in a js file?

Routes defines API endpoints and maps them to controller functions. So like, adding a movie, deleting one, or picking a random movie. 

Config holds configuration files for database connection logic. This happens in a js file and gets info out of .env to do it?

I don't think I'll worry about setting up a local server for now. I'm interested in just getting the code set up and working for my server hosted on MochaHost. I might migrate it later but let's not worry about that yet.

This is all high-level discussion for now. Don't worry about the code yet. Can you give me an example of what the .env file contents would look like?


Prompt 3:

Alright. Let's begin to set this up. I would like to get it set up locally using Express, Node, and ejs. I need to have it set up locally before moving it to MochaHost so I can test everything and potentially save a lot of time for myself uploading files each time I make a change. I'm mildly familiar with Node.js and Express.js, but have forgotten a lot of it. I have VSCode terminal open in the noahsnook directory. For now, I would just like to make sure I can get an express server working. How should I go about beginning this project?


Prompt 4:

Continue to act as a full-stack software engineering manager to help guide this project. I understand the role of the server.js is to start the server, and handle requests. I was unaware that server.js is where we would connect to the database. Is that normal and correct considering our file structure? I have shared the file structure again below.

I understand how to import the packages as well as create an instance of the express application. Why is it necessary to call .config() on the dotenv package but not the others?

Describe the role of middleware for me. Describe what a view engine does. What does app.set as well as app.use do? I also don't know what path.join or path.resolve means. I am also confused by the different express.static, express.json, and express.urlencoded commands. Explain each please. Please provide links to documentation so I may also review it independently. Also, describe the role of views for me. I've never learned about this before.

So, process.env.DB_HOST is how I would access stuff inside of the .env file? Describe what the .env file would look like.

I do not yet understand routing yet. We'll focus on this in a minute. For now, let's just focus on getting the server to launch.

After you're finished explaining, share the modified example of server.js as well as what commands should be run to get the server to launch.


Prompt 5:

I understand that dotenv.config() is called to load env variables (such as database information). 

Middleware I am still shakey on but am confident I will understand after further examples.

I see. So ejs is considered a "view engine". I understand ejs's role as a templating language but had never heard of the term view engine before.

I understand all ejs files go into views now. I understand what
