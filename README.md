## Description
Noah's Nook is my own little corner of the internet. It primarily operates as my ePortfolio. It not only highlights work from my formal education studying Computer Science, but also showcases some of my personal and independent projects as a programmer. The site may also be used to get in contact with me.

Title
Noah's Nook
My own little corner of the internet.

About Me
Hi, I'm Noah Ewell.
A Professional Software Engineer
I also do a little design and I built an arduino claw machine once but I feel like I talk about that too much... Did you want to see it? 
A Continual Learner
Open-minded and teachable, I strive to learn and apply new concepts everyday.
A Strategy Game Enthusiest
Perhaps my most important characteristic -- Age of Empires II and Risk are some of my favorites.
